**So how's the idea came out ?**
Basically in my college there is this course known "Project Exhibition" , Where we make a group of certain fellow peers and make a project within a given period of time , it consist of 3 reviews where certain amount 
of work completion must be done for getting good marks. So being a "E-Commerce Specialization" Student and also my interest aligns with this idea of having the freedom to look out for any other good offers for the same product 
one is looking for !! **Why extension?** Extension are more easy to use than a website ig , also kind of give an minimal feel .
